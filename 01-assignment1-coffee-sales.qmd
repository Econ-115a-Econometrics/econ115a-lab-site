**Course title**: Econ115a: Econometrics <br> **Instructor**: Christopher Llones <br> **Assignment**: Coffee Sales Dataset Analysis in R <br> **Due Date**: 15 October 2025


## Objective

This assignment will help you apply R programming skills to analyze real-world sales data from a coffee shop. You’ll use `dplyr` and other relevant packages to explore customer behavior, beverage preferences, and sales performance across time and payment methods.


## Instructions

- Use R and the `dplyr` package to answer each question.

- Submit your R script file (.R) with your code and outputs.

- Use the pipe operator (`%>%`) for all data manipulations.

- You may use additional packages like `lubridate`, `ggplot2`, or `stringr` if needed.

- Ensure your code is clean, commented, and reproducible.

## Questions

**Part 1: Data exploration**

1. How many rows and columns are in the dataset?

2. List all unique coffee types sold.

3. What are the earliest and latest transaction dates?

**Part 2: sales behavior**

4. What is the total revenue generated across all transactions?

5. Which beverage type generated the highest total sales?

6. What is the average amount spent per transaction?

**Part 3: time-based analysis**

7.  Which time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) had the highest average spending?

8. Which weekday had the most transactions?

9. What is the most popular beverage during the evening?

**Part 4: payment method insights**

10. Compare total revenue between cash and card payments.

11. What percentage of transactions were made using card?

12. Is there a noticeable spending difference between payment methods?


**Bonus Challenge**

13. Create a monthly summary of total sales. Which month had the highest revenue?

14. Identify any beverage that consistently appears in high-spending transactions (above ₱35).



## Grading rubrics

| Criteria | Excellent (5pts) | Good (4pts) | Fair (2-3 pts) | Needs improvement (0-1 pt) |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Code accuracy** | All answers are correct and match expected outputs. | Most answers are correct with minor errors. | Several answers are incorrect or incomplete. | Many answers are missing or incorrect. |
| **Use of** `dplyr` **Functions** | Consistently uses appropriate `dplyr` verbs (`filter`, `mutate`, `summarise`, etc.). | Uses `dplyr` functions correctly in most cases. | Uses some `dplyr` functions but inconsistently or incorrectly. | Rarely uses `dplyr` or misuses functions. |
| **Pipe Operator Usage (**`%>%`**)** | Pipe operator is used fluently and correctly throughout. | Mostly correct usage with occasional syntax issues. | Used sporadically or with frequent errors. | Not used or used incorrectly. |
| **Data Manipulation & Filtering** | Demonstrates strong understanding of filtering, grouping, and summarizing. | Shows good grasp with minor gaps. | Basic filtering and grouping attempted but lacks depth. | Little to no meaningful data manipulation. |
| **Insight & Interpretation** | Provides thoughtful insights or observations where applicable. | Some interpretation is present. | Minimal interpretation or unclear reasoning. | No interpretation or irrelevant commentary. |
| **Bonus Challenge (Q13–Q14)** | Completed with correct logic and creative approach. | Attempted with mostly correct logic. | Attempted but contains errors or lacks clarity. | Not attempted or incorrect. |
| **Reproducibility** | Code runs without errors and produces expected results. | Minor issues but generally reproducible. | Some errors prevent full reproducibility. | Code fails to run or produces major errors. |
